//! Bengali has two encodings for several letters, and input methods disagree
//! about which to produce. `য়` is either U+09DF or `য` U+09AF followed by a
//! nukta U+09BC; `ড়` and `ঢ়` are the same story. Unicode lists all three
//! precomposed forms as composition exclusions, so NFC settles on the
//! two-codepoint spelling.
//!
//! Two source files can therefore be identical on screen and differ in bytes.
//! Before the lexer normalized, `শেয়ার` and `ডায়ালগ` typed the precomposed way
//! were not keywords at all, and the parse error that followed pointed at text
//! that looked exactly right.
